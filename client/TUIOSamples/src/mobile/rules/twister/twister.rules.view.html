        You will play this game in two teams, which will be randomly generated.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of Twister is to realize as many color combinations as you can. On the right, you'll see instructions of what you
        have to do, for example :
    </p>

    <ul class="instructions">
        <li>Collect 3 red pellets ;</li>
        <li>Collect 6 yellow pellets ;</li>
        <li>Collect 0 green pellets ;</li>
        <li>Collect 4 blue pellets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The team that has been able to realize the maximum of combinations in a given time wins! :-)
